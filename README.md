# M5 Forecasting - Accuracy (Walmart Sales Forecasting)
#### Estimate the unit sales of Walmart retail goods

### Description
In the [M5 Forecasting - Accuracy](https://www.kaggle.com/c/m5-forecasting-accuracy/overview) on Kaggle, participants have the challenge using hierarchical sales data from Walmart, the worldâ€™s largest company by revenue, to **forecast daily sales for the next 28 days.** As these forecasting may lead to provide supply of right product at right store at right time, keeping balance in inventory levels and this can lead to increase in revenue. 

[The Data ](https://www.kaggle.com/c/m5-forecasting-accuracy/data) comprises 3049 individual products from 3 categories and 7 departments, sold in 10 stores in 3 states. The hierachical aggregation captures the combinations of these factors. For instance, we can create 1 time series for all sales, 3 time series for all sales per state, and so on. The largest category is sales of all individual 3049 products per 10 stores for 30490 time series.

**The Objective of this notebook is to get insights about data **Exploratory Data Analysis** (EDA), preprocess it's features and get data ready for modelling.**
